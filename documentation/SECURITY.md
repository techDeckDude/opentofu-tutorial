Yes, there are several ways to improve the security of this Terraform (OpenTofu) configuration for running a PostgreSQL container with Docker:

1. Avoid Storing Secrets in Plaintext
The postgres_password variable is marked as sensitive = true, which is good, but it still has no default value. Ensure you never set a default password in the code. Encourage usage of environment variables or secure secret stores (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to inject secrets at runtime.
2. Limit Network Exposure
The PostgreSQL container is exposing port 5432 to the host. If this is a development environment, thatâ€™s fine, but for production or shared environments:
Only expose PostgreSQL to trusted IPs or localhost.
For example, use:
HCL
ports {
  internal = 5432
  external = 127.0.0.1:5432
}
Consider using Docker networks to isolate the container and prevent unwanted access.
3. Restrict Volume Mounts
Mounting /var/lib/postgresql/data from the host can be risky if permissions are too open.
Ensure the directory on the host has proper permissions (owned by the docker user, not world-writable).
Avoid mounting sensitive host directories as volumes unless necessary.
4. Pin Image Versions
Using postgres:latest can lead to unexpected updates and potential vulnerabilities.
Pin to a specific version (e.g., postgres:15.3) and update intentionally.
5. Drop Unnecessary Capabilities
By default, containers may have more privileges than needed.
Consider running the container with reduced privileges (e.g., user directive in the image, or drop capabilities using Docker security options).
For example, add to the container block (if supported by provider):
HCL
security_opts = ["no-new-privileges:true"]
6. Environment Variables Exposure
Sensitive environment variables (like passwords) can sometimes be accessed via container logs or inspection.
Use Docker secrets if available, or ensure container logs do not leak secrets.
7. Avoid Root User
Ensure the PostgreSQL container does not run as root unless strictly necessary.
8. Remove Unnecessary Comments in Production
Comments with instructions or gotchas are helpful for development, but for production code, remove anything that may leak operational info or credentials.
Summary of Key Changes for Security:

Don't hardcode secrets; use secret managers or environment injection.
Limit network exposure (bind to localhost or internal network).
Pin Docker image versions.
Restrict file system access (and permissions) on mounted volumes.
Drop unnecessary privileges for the container.
Remove or secure sensitive operational comments.
